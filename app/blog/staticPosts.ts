## Why Local Context Helps

Kensington Green is tied to Dundas St W and Roncesvalles context in Toronto. Useful local content should make the page easier for shoppers to understand by connecting the store to nearby streets, neighbourhood language, and visit-planning details already supported by the site.

If you need a quick answer before heading out, check the store page first and contact the store directly for help from staff.

## Browse Menu Categories With Confidence

Menu category labels help adults 19+ move quickly from general store research to the product areas they care about. Use them to compare the sections already shown on the site, such as flower, pre-rolls, vapes, edibles, concentrates, accessories, or other store categories.

That makes the page easier to scan and gives shoppers a cleaner path from local research to the right store page.

## Adult 19+ Visit Basics

Adults 19+ should bring valid government identification, confirm the store page before leaving, and use the menu/category links to narrow down what they want to ask about in-store.
